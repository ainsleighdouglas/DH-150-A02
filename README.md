Usability Evaluation with Users - Pilot Test

## Introduction
###Streaming Platform - Hulu
It's important in this day in age to find ways to destress and create a sense of relaxation. Simple pleasures to often appear as alone time with your personal device in a quiet area of your home. Since technology is so embedded in our everyday lives we often find solace in a good TV show and a nice snack. It is important that streaming devices are easy to use and intuitive, but most importantly that way there is no extra stress added. If the user's cognitive load is burdened with over complicated tasks then the app/site will be doing the opposite of its given purpose.

Usability testing of a streaming device is critical to ensure that tasks are intuitive, even when trying to include a variety of information on said app. UT helps the designer better understand the level of knowledge/relationship a specific audience has with an interface. In my research, streaming platforms come in a wide variety of options, some are easier to use than others. From past experience, Hulu is deemed one of the least intuitive platforms, however it has one of the most abundant selections. Different age groups and demographics have varying experience using streaming platforms and things that should seem obvious may not be. A mid-aged woman may want to complete a certain task that is difficult to do on Hulu, which affect her overall experience and happiness rating.  

In my pilot test I will be interviewing a young adult female, although this is not my target audience it gives me more information about usability in the app. Her response to the different task will show me how someone's mood/happiness can be altered by simply bad or good design. I will be focusing on visibility of system status, recognition rather than recall and flexibility and efficiency of use. These are all basic necessities to making an efficient and intuitive streaming platform.

## Reflection
After conducting the usability test I was able to draw a lot of information for future tests. To begin, as an examiner there were many points at which I could improve. The first being making an environment more natural for my user to comfortably scroll the app. The environment definitely improved as the interview continued but could have been better from the start. Additionally, I would improve my phrasing of specific questions and how I chose to guide my participant through each question. I struggled to find a balance between guiding them and just blatantly telling them where the answer is. Lastly, I attempted to find tasks that would be challenging, but some tasks were more obvious to my participant while others were not. As a designer there are key characteristics that I look for when I label items, for example I would always look for a navigation bar at the top of the screen. However, on a mobile device navigation bars are listed sometimes on the bottom. Since my participant was more familiar with mobile devices they looked at the bottom where I was referring to the top. These are all good take-aways and will be useful for future testing.
