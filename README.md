Usability Evaluation with Users - Pilot Test

## Introduction
It's important in this day in age to find ways to destress and create a sense of relaxation. Simple pleasures to often appear as alone time with your personal device in a quiet area of your home. Since technology is so embedded in our everyday lives we often find solace in a good TV show and a nice snack. It is important that streaming devices are easy to use and intuitive, but most importantly that way there is no extra stress added. If the user's cognitive load is burdened with over complicated tasks then the app/site will be doing the opposite of its given purpose.

Usability testing of a streaming device is critical to ensure that tasks are intuitive, even when trying to include a variety of information on said app. UT helps the designer better understand the level of knowledge/relationship a specific audience has with an interface. In my research, streaming platforms come in a wide variety of options, some are easier to use than others. From past experience, Hulu is deemed one of the least intuitive platforms, however it has one of the most abundant selections. Different age groups and demographics have varying experience using streaming platforms and things that should seem obvious may not be. A mid-aged woman may want to complete a certain task that is difficult to do on Hulu, which affect her overall experience and happiness rating.  

In my pilot test I will be interviewing a young adult female, although this is not my target audience it gives me more information about usability in the app. Her response to the different task will show me how someone's mood/happiness can be altered by simply bad or good design. I will be focusing on visibility of system status, recognition rather than recall and flexibility and efficiency of use. These are all basic necessities to making an efficient and intuitive streaming platform.
